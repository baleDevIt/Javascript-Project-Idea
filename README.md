 ### Calculator
A classic in educational projects! The realization of a working calculator allows to solve some common realization difficulties. It is advisable to implement the basic functions of a calculator (addition, subtraction, division and multiplication), not to allow the user to enter more than 12 digits including operator and to perform one operation at a time.
[2 + 2] (ok)
[2 + 3 + 2] (no!)

If you want to increase the difficulty, it is advisable to remove the last constraint and allow the user to enter digits greater than 12.
